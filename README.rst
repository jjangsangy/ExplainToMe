What is it?
===========

``Explain To Me`` is a automatic text summarizer, that utilizes
`TextRank <http://web.eecs.umich.edu/~mihalcea/papers/mihalcea.emnlp04.pdf>`__,
a graph based algorithm to scans through the contents of a website or
text document to extract a concise machine generated summary composed of
the most informative pieces. The methodology is similar to the way
search engines return the most relevant web pages from a users search
query.

Things to look forward to:
--------------------------

-  Summaries of documents in other languages than English!
-  Summaries of documents from english semantically translated into
   other languages.
-  *Maybe*: Summaries from n quantity languages translated into any n
   language
